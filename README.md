# FolderDetailsLister

Simple C_++ program to list details of a folder to the user. Right now it is confined to the size of the folder from any passed CMD/bash dir.

## Dependencies

Created using the boost library.
Since C++11 is used we have no access to the C++17 filesystem library. Therefore we use boost.

CFLAG = -lboost__system -lboost_filesystem.
